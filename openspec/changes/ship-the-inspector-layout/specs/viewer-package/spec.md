## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The viewer declares its API version

The package SHALL declare one API version, expose it on every mount handle and
the browser global, and make it readable without executing the bundle. It SHALL
be raised whenever the mount interface or handle changes incompatibly, and when
a capability a host may require is added. The declared version SHALL be 11,
reflecting the addition of the inspector layout — the composed sidebar,
navigator and viewer the bundle mounts into one host element, and the
development page's own mount built on it — on top of the mountable assembly
navigator, the published assembly-navigation state and its change
subscription.

The package SHALL also declare, in the same one place, the document schema
versions this build reads, and SHALL report them beside the API version
wherever the API version is reported. A consumer asking which documents a
viewer reads SHALL be answered with that list rather than having to infer
it from the API version, and a consumer that receives no such list SHALL be
entitled to assume the versions every released viewer reads.

#### Scenario: A host checks compatibility before mounting

- **WHEN** a host reads the installed viewer API version
- **THEN** it obtains the package's single declared version without running a
  browser bundle

#### Scenario: A mounted viewer reports its version

- **WHEN** a host inspects a mount handle or the browser global
- **THEN** both report the same declared API version

#### Scenario: A host requires targeted updates

- **WHEN** a host needs `artifactChanged()` and `manifestChanged()`
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether they are available

#### Scenario: A host requires camera orientation control

- **WHEN** a host needs to supply an up direction and field of view
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether they are available

#### Scenario: A host requires flexible geometry

- **WHEN** a host needs `version: 3` documents rendered
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether the capability is
  available

#### Scenario: A host requires documents carrying a bindings table

- **WHEN** a host needs `version: 4` documents rendered
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether the capability is
  available

#### Scenario: A host requires the published navigation state

- **WHEN** a host needs to read the focused root and the hidden paths, and
  to be told when they change
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether the capability is
  available, before it mounts a bundle it cannot build a navigator on

#### Scenario: A host requires the mountable navigator

- **WHEN** a host means to present the package's own assembly navigator
  rather than build one
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether the bundle carries
  one, before it mounts a bundle that publishes the navigation state but
  no navigator

#### Scenario: A host requires the inspector layout

- **WHEN** a host means to mount the package's composed inspector —
  sidebar, navigator and viewer in one element — rather than lay those
  parts out itself
- **THEN** the declared API version tells it whether the bundle carries
  one, before it mounts a bundle that carries a navigator and no layout to
  put it in

#### Scenario: A producer asks which documents this viewer reads

- **WHEN** a producer asks the installed viewer what it reads, before
  publishing a document
- **THEN** it receives the list of document schema versions this build
  renders, including the running version, from the same declaration the
  bundle refuses by
